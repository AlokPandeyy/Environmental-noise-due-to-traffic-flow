# Environmental-noise-due-to-traffic-flow
Worked on traffic data analysis to understand vehicle flow and congestion patterns. Cleaned and processed data from multiple locations, identified peak traffic hours, and used clustering and visualizations to find trends. Aimed to support better urban mobility and transport planning.


Traffic Data & Environmental Noise Analysis – Urban Mobility & Pollution


This project focuses on analyzing traffic data from different urban locations to understand vehicle movement, pollution, and noise levels. Along with studying peak traffic trends and vehicle types, I also worked on predicting environmental noise caused by traffic using machine learning and deep learning models.



What I Did
	•	Cleaned and organized raw traffic data from multiple locations
	•	Analyzed hourly vehicle counts and flow patterns
	•	Identified which vehicle types contributed the most to air pollution
	•	Used clustering to group locations with similar traffic behavior
	•	Built predictive models for environmental noise using:
	•	Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and ANN
	•	Evaluated models using MSE, RMSE, and MAE
	•	Used feature importance and permutation analysis to find what affects noise levels the most
	•	Created visualizations to show traffic trends, pollution, and noise patterns



Why I Did This

The aim was to get a better understanding of urban traffic patterns and their environmental impact. Predicting noise and identifying key pollution sources can help in planning cleaner and quieter cities.
